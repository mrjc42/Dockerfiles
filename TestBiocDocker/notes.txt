## This command will launch the devel base version of R and mount the working dir as '/scratch'. But the user needs to still setwd() to that space.
docker run -ti -v `pwd`:/scratch bioconductor/devel_base R

## Here is a more recent command that gets me access to more than one place
docker run -ti -v `pwd`:/scratch -v /home/mcarl7/Personal/DockerTests/Dockerfiles/TestBiocDocker/myLib:/myLib bioconductor/devel_base R
## Then from R I have to do this
setwd('scratch')
## And this to set up the library path:
.libPaths(c('/myLib',.libPaths()))


## Here is a command to launch it with RStudio (the paths are different though):
docker run -p 8787:8787 -v `pwd`:/scratch -v /home/mcarl7/Personal/DockerTests/Dockerfiles/TestBiocDocker/myLib:/myLib bioconductor/devel_base

## Then you can access it like this:
http://sideswiper:8787

## And since Rstudio thinks that the home dir needs to always be this: "/home/rstudio"
docker run -p 8787:8787 -v `pwd`:/home/rstudio -v /home/mcarl7/Personal/DockerTests/Dockerfiles/TestBiocDocker/myLib:/usr/local/lib/R/site-library bioconductor/devel_base


## And here is the command I will use so that I can start working on class materials (launch it from: /home/mcarl7/Personal/Courses/SCRICompBioCourses)
docker run -p 8787:8787 -v /home/mcarl7/Personal/RStudioSpace/scratchSpace:/home/rstudio -v /home/mcarl7/Personal/RStudioSpace/myLib:/usr/local/lib/R/site-library bioconductor/devel_base


## But that command will ALSO cause issues since it will effectively REPLACE an important library (one that has BiocInstaller).  So actually I need to do it like this:
docker run -p 8787:8787 -v /home/mcarl7/Personal/RStudioSpace/scratchSpace:/home/rstudio -v /home/mcarl7/Personal/RStudioSpace/myLib:/myLib bioconductor/devel_base

## And then follow up with this (if package installation is needed):
.libPaths(c('/myLib',.libPaths()))
## or better yet, make a new dockerfile to wrap that command into a single image (so it's always ready to go)
