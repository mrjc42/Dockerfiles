## This command will launch the devel base version of R and mount the working dir as '/scratch'. But the user needs to still setwd() to that space.
docker run -ti -v `pwd`:/scratch bioconductor/devel_base R

## Here is a more recent command that gets me access to more than one place
docker run -ti -v `pwd`:/scratch -v /home/mcarl7/Personal/DockerTests/Dockerfiles/TestBiocDocker/myLib:/myLib bioconductor/devel_base R
## Then from R I have to do this
setwd('scratch')
## And this to set up the library path:
.libPaths(c('/myLib',.libPaths()))
